### What Does Sensitivity to xG and xGA Mean?

- **Sensitivity to xG:** This value indicates how much **expected points** would change for every **0.5-unit increase in xG per game**, while keeping **xGA constant**. 
- For example, if the sensitivity to xG is 23.32, this means that for every **0.5-unit increase in xG per game**, the team would expect an additional **23.32 points** over the course of the season. 
- A higher sensitivity to xG means **improving attacking performance** will have a **large impact** on expected points.

- **Sensitivity to xGA:** This value shows how much **expected points** would change for every **0.5-unit decrease in xGA per game**, while keeping **xG constant**. 
- For example, if the sensitivity to xGA is -18.75, this means that for every **0.5-unit decrease in xGA per game**, the team would expect an additional **18.75 points** over the course of the season. 
- A higher sensitivity to xGA means **improving defensive performance** (lowering xGA) will have a **large impact** on expected points.

### Which Should You Focus On?
- If the sensitivity to **xG** is higher, then improving your team's attacking performance is the best way to increase expected points.
- If the sensitivity to **xGA** is higher, then focusing on improving your defense will yield a better return in terms of points.
